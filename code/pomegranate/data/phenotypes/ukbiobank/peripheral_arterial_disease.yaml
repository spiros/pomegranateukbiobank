  short_desc: A disorder of the arteries supplying the upper and lower extremity and
    the visceral organs. This includes the mesenteric arteries, the renal arteries
    and the aorta and excludes cerebrovascular arterial disease. Patients experience
    cramping and pain usually in the calves and thighs while walking. The symptoms
    subside with rest.
