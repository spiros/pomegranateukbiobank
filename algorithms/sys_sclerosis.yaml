  short_desc: A chronic disorder, possibly autoimmune, marked by excessive production
    of collagen which results in hardening and thickening of body tissues. The two
    types of systemic scleroderma, limited cutaneous and diffuse cutaneous are classified
    with focus on the extent of affected skin. A relationship exists between the extent
    of skin area affected and degree of internal organ/system involvement. Systemic
    scleroderma can manifest itself in pulmonary fibrosis, Raynaud's syndrome, digestive
    system telangiectasias, renal hypertension and/or pulmonary hypertension.
