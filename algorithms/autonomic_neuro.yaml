  short_desc: Diseases of the parasympathetic or sympathetic divisions of the AUTONOMIC
    NERVOUS SYSTEM; which has components located in the CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM and
    PERIPHERAL NERVOUS SYSTEM. Autonomic dysfunction may be associated with HYPOTHALAMIC
    DISEASES; BRAIN STEM disorders; SPINAL CORD DISEASES; and PERIPHERAL NERVOUS SYSTEM
    DISEASES. Manifestations include impairments of vegetative functions including
    the maintenance of BLOOD PRESSURE; HEART RATE; pupil function; SWEATING; REPRODUCTIVE
    AND URINARY PHYSIOLOGY; and DIGESTION.
