  short_desc: Subnormal intellectual functioning which originates during the developmental
    period. This has multiple potential etiologies, including genetic defects and
    perinatal insults. Intelligence quotient (IQ) scores are commonly used to determine
    whether an individual has an intellectual disability. IQ scores between 70 and
    79 are in the borderline range. Scores below 67 are in the disabled range.
